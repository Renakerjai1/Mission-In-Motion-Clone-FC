	<h3>What We are Searching For</h3>
	<p> We are looking for <b >new</b> or <b>gently used</b> shoes to give to those who are not fortunate enough to own a sturdy pair of shoes. All donated <b>new</b> and <b>gently used</b> shoes will be redistributed through micro-enterprise partners and used in developing nations for impoverished people to start, maintain, and grow an enterprise to feed, clothe, and house their families.

<div class="row">
	<div class="col">
		<h4>Shoes that would be great for donating</h4>
		<ul>
			
			<li>Shoes that you do not wear any more</li>
			<li>All shapes and sizes of pairs of shoes</li>
			<li>Baby, infant, toddler, child, teen, and adult</li>
			<li>Boots, flip-flops, sandals, tennis shoes, dress shoes, hiking shoes, cleats, etc.</li>
			<li>Clean shoes</li>
		</ul>

		<p> Only <b>new</b> or <b> gently used</b> pairs can be accepted.</p>
		<h4>Ways you can help us</h4>
		<hr>
		<h4>Host a Shoe Drive</h4>
		<p>Host a Shoe Drive as a Service Project or as a Fundraiser! Any business, group, or individual can host a Shoe Drive as a Service Project, but only non-profits can host a Shoe Drive as a Fundraiser and earn 10 cents per pound of shoes you collect.  It is your choice, they both are fun and people love to give their <b> new </b> or <b> gently used pairs</b> of shoes to those in need! Join other groups and individuals that are getting involved in this "pay-it-forward" concept and getting others involved as well. This is a great fundraiser without having to sell anything! People love to give you their <b> new </b> or <b> gently used pairs</b> of shoes!</p>
		<hr>
		<h4>Be a Drop Off Location</h4>
		<p>Missions In Motion International Ministries receives many calls asking where people can drop off their shoes in their local community. As a result, we have developed partnerships with local businesses to provide Shoes for H.O.P.E. drop off locations. Just place one of our collection bins in a visible location at your site, and allow people to drop off their shoes during normal business hours.</p>
		<hr>
		<h4>Volunteer at our Warehouse</h4>
		<p>Occasionally we host "Shoe Packing Parties" to help us sort, count, and bag shoes to get them ready for shipment. We also need help on shipment days. These are great team building opportunities and great for individuals and families!</p>
		<br>
