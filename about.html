					Dan and Cathy Shupe met while they were both attending Ohio Northern University. They became best friends, and then college sweethearts. They were married in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1987. In 1993, their amazing son, Zacharyah was born. The three of them have always enjoyed doing things as a family, including serving in various church ministries. So when God spoke to Dan about beginning a ministry that would make it easier for people to get involved in missions, it was only natural that the whole family would get involved. God confirmed the calling in Cathy and Zacharyah’s heart on a mission trip to Jamaica in 2011. That same year Missions In Motion International Ministries was birthed. Since then, the Shupe family has helped engage numerous families and individuals in missions work and disaster relief efforts around the world. The Shupe family has a passion for people of all races and all ages. They believe God has blessed every person, young and old, with unique gifts and talents. They want to help people utilize those wonderful gifts and talents in the mission field and during disaster relief efforts. The Shupe family enjoys working with people to help them excel spiritually and physically for the Kingdom of God. </p>
<br><p style="font-size: 1em; text-indent: 2em">
“We are so thankful for this ministry that God has birthed. It is our desire to answer His call, and help people get involved in local and foreign missions in ways they might not have thought possible. With God, all things are possible! One of our desires is to see the body of Christ come together in unity, serving the Lord side by side as we minister to the spiritual and physical needs of people all over the globe. We are very family-oriented, and believe it is important for families to have the opportunity to minister together. We also understand the importance of making our mission opportunities as affordable as possible, in order to make it feasible for family members to serve together. Thank you for visiting our web site. Please take some time to look around, and get an idea of what we’re about and the things we do."</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><small>Blessings, Dan, Cathy, & Zacharyah Shupe</small></p>

			<h3>Statement of Faith</h3>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col SOF">
				<p>*We believe the Bible to be the inspired, the only infallible, authoritative Word of God.</p>
				<p><small>John 16:13; II Timothy 3:15-17; 2 Peter 1:21; 1 Thessalonians 2:13</small></p>
				<p>*We believe in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His sinless life, in His miracles, in His vicarious and atoning death through His shed blood, in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and in His personal return in power and glory</p>
				<p> <small>Isaiah 7:14 & 9:6; Matthew 1:18,23 & 4:23; Luke 1:34-35 & 6:17-19 & 24:4-7, 36-48; John 1:1-4, 14 & 3:2 & 20:28-29; Acts 1:11 & 2:22-24, 33 & 5:30-31; Romans 5:8-9; I Corinthians 15:3-4; 2 Corinthians 5:21; Ephesians 1:7; Philippians 2:5-11; Colossians 1:14, 20 & 2:9; Hebrews 1:1-4 & 4:15 & 7:26-27; 1 Peter 3:22; 1 John 3:5; Revelation 1:17-18 </small></p>
				<p>*We believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit which includes: the Baptism in the Holy Spirit as an experience distinct from regeneration; His indwelling, by which the Christian is enabled to live a godly life; His supernatural gifting and empowering of the Church for its work, life and worship.</p>
				<p> <small>Luke 24:49; Acts 1:4-8 & 2:1-4 & 10:44-46; Galatians 5:16-18; Romans 8:9</small></p>
				<p>*We believe in the spiritual unity of believers in our Lord Jesus Christ and that all true believers are members of His body, the Church.</p>
				<p> <small> Ephesians 1:22-23; I Corinthians 12:12, 27 </small></p>


			</div>
			<div class="col SOF">
				<p>*We believe there is one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. </p>
				<p> <small>Deuteronomy 6:4; Isaiah 43:10-11; Matthew 28:19; Luke 3:22; John 14:16; Ephesians 4:4-6</small></p>
				<p>*We believe that, for the salvation of lost and sinful man, repentance of sin and faith in Jesus Christ results in regeneration by the Holy Spirit and that Jesus Christ is the only way of salvation. </p>
				<p> <small> Titus 3:4-7; Luke 24:46-47; Ephesians 2:8-9; John 14:6; Acts 4:12</small></p>
				<p>*We believe in the return of Jesus Christ, to consummate His Kingdom, in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost; the saved unto the resurrection of eternal life and the lost unto the resurrection of damnation and eternal punishment. </p>
				<p><small>John 5:28-29; Mark 14:62; 1 Corinthians 15:51-57; 2 Thessalonians 1:2-10; Revelation 1:5-7 & 20:4-5, 11-15</small></p>
				<p>*We believe that the ministry of evangelism is a responsibility of both the Church and each Christian.</p>
				<p><small> Romans 10:9-15; Acts 1:8; Matthew 28:18-20; I Peter 3:15</small></p>
