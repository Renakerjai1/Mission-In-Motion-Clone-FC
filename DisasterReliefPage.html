<p>There are all types of natural disasters: floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, landslides, blizzards, and fire, just to name a few. Some we can prepare for and some we can not; regardless it is still a huge impact on the ones involved. Missions In Motion International Ministries helps people affected by natural disasters by being the "hands and feet of Jesus" and offering HOPE through the love of Christ. We not only help with the clean up efforts and rebuild efforts, but also provide H.O.P.E. Baskets to those affected by the disaster. Our H.O.P.E. Baskets are filled with much-needed items and some "special" surprises for the families. </p>
<p>We make a POSITIVE IMPACT. We bring HOPE. We SHARE the LOVE of Christ. Sometimes just being available to help serve makes a BIG difference in someone's life when they have lost so much through a disaster. When you serve others, it brings joy not only to the ones you are serving, but also to you! </p>
<p>Will you join us in serving those affect by a disaster? In some cases precious lives are lost, people are stranded and left without homes, cars, and loved ones. We have the honor working alongside our partners, and ministering to the survivors, while at the same time working to help rebuild, repair, and restore some of their homes.</p>
