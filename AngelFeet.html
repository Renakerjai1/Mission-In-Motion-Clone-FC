	<h3>Serving Children in Need</h3><!-- title-->
	<p> Missions In Motion International Ministries' Angel Feet program allows groups and individuals to donate NEW Socks and NEW Shoes that will be hand-delivered to those in need. We have visited various parts of the USA as well as developing nations and have seen the need for children whom we call "Angels" to have socks and shoes so they can attend school. The socks and shoes also provide protection from everyday germs and infection. Our Angel Feet program has the amazing opportunity to serve people in the USA as well as developing nations. We get the honor of cleaning the Angels' precious feet, then we put <b> new socks</b> and <b> new shoes </b> on them. We have personally seen where just the simple washing of their feet has calmed a crying baby, put a smile on a mama’s face knowing her child now has socks and shoes, as well as a smile on a child’s face! A group of teenage boys were so excited to have a pair of shoes that fit their feet!

		<h4>Ways you can help us</h4>
		<hr>
		<h4>Host a Shoe or Sock Drive</h4>
		<p>Host a Shoe or Sock Drive as a Service Project or as a Fundraiser! Any business, group, or individual can host a Shoe or Sock Drive as a Service Project, but only non-profits can host a Shoe or Sock Drive as a Fundraiser and earn 10 cents per pound of shoes you collect. It is your choice, they both are fun and people love to give their <b> new </b> or <b> gently used pairs</b> of shoes to those in need! Join other groups and individuals that are getting involved in this "pay-it-forward" concept and getting others involved as well. This is a great fundraiser without having to sell anything! People love to give you their <b> new </b> or <b> gently used pairs</b> of shoes, along with new pairs of children's sizes of socks!</p>
		<hr>
		<h4>Be a Drop Off Location</h4>
		<p>>Missions In Motion International Ministries receives many calls asking where people can drop off their shoes in their local community. As a result, we have developed partnerships with local businesses to provide Shoes for H.O.P.E. drop off locations. Just place one of our collection bins in a visible location at your site, and allow people to drop off their shoes and socks during normal business hours.</p>
		<hr>
		<h4>Volunteer at our Warehouse</h4>
		<p>Occasionally we host "Shoe and Sock Packing Parties" to help us sort, count, and bag shoes and socks to get them ready for shipment. We also need help on shipment days. These are great team building opportunities and great for individuals and families!</p>
